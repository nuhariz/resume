	hurmm.... 
<p> 
	At first when i received the offer i was not happy because i did not expect that i will further my studies in Kelantan but yet i still go and do some registration. Found out that UiTM Machang is not bad as what i have been thought before. Everyday i kept telling myself that i should accept this with an open heart so that it will ease everything for me. Im making some effort to love this place, i did a lot. I joined Student Representatitve Council as their secretariat. 
<P> 
	By knowing them, im starting to love this place. As time goes by, i did it. I love UiTM Machang so much. From that moment, i promised to myself, that i should study wisely and get a vice cansellor awards its means that i need to get dean's list award every semester. Crackk. 
<P> 
	Im one of student that i can say being active involve with university program, college and everything. I love to explore and trying new things here. I gained a lots of friends. I knew a lots of staff in UiTM. I gained a lot knowledge about how to handle my life, how to manage my time wisely since i have been busy with those program. I do not have a normal routine as others have. I need to make my own time to study and get some rest but then its worth it! 
	<P>
		Every semester i managed to get dean's list and i managed to get vice cansellor awards for my diploma. Everyone is happy for my achievement. I already proof it to some of people that keep saying that you're weak you're this and that. The negative vibes that i have i turned it into a something that can motivate myself to be a better person in university. 

	<P> 
		Luckily, in UiTM Machang i have met and knew a group of people that keep supporting and gives a lot of motivations for me. They are one of the reason why im doing this kind of things during my diploma. Without them, i dont think that i can manage to handle everything in one moment. 
	<P> 
		its not easy but its not possible to achieve. Just stay positive and keep strong to achieve what you want. My GCPA for diploma is 3.64. By having that kinds of GCPA, i having a little bit nervous to further my study in bachelor, because it is kind of my benchmark to get more than that in my degree. 
		Not hoping but my trying to best to get a flying colors during my degree journey !
