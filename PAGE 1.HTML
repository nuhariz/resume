<P> <font face = "book antigua" font size = '+2'> Like i said in the introduction, i have been studied at SMK Tanjong Chat. When i entered the school, the school was quite new, im the third batch of the school. So, the equipment in the school is still in a good condition and still we have a lack of fasility at the school but then still blessed. 
<P> My very first year i was in that school, i was approached by my teacher to join a competition which is a choral speaking competition. I was not the type that loves to join the competition and i dont a self-confident, but then when my teacher asked me to do so, i think that is maybe the starting point for me to build a self-confident and be a better person. So i have been with choral speaking team for just 3 years, because for the forth year, i got to join a competition that represent our state. Which i have to give more focus and i do not have enough time to go and having a practices with choral speaking team, so i decided and have been advice by the advisor tu just quit and focus on one competition. 
<P>
The competition that i have been joined was Toyota Eco Youth (TEY) organized by UMW Toyota Motor. So the competition was started as early as January and ended at November which mean my team and i have to work for it for one year. We did our best and we won at the third place.

My journey at my high school was not easy as people thought, because i need to manage my time wisely, so that while im being active with the co-curriculur, i also get flying colors in every examination session. My SPM result is not good as others, i get 2A 2A- 1B+ 2C+ 2D. Which is not too bad but yet not too good. I hoping for the best when i entered the university life..
